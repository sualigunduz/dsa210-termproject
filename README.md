## dsa210-termproject
This is my term project for the course, DSA210: Introduction to Data Science, in the 2024-25 Spring term.

# Project Proposal
In this project, I will be exploring the relationship between air quality, a crucial factor in a person's health and quality of life, and housing prices, an analog to the demand a specific place has when it comes to living there, as time goes on.
## Motivation
Sabancı University's campus in Tuzla, İstanbul is in close proximity to an 'Organized Industrial Zone', an area of land designated by public authorities for industrial facilities to reside in together, allowing industry to work effectively and efficiently. A major downside is these industrial zones bring lots of pollution with them, as a side effect of waste produced by said facilities. Students of our university often complain about the quality of the air, bad odors, and trouble breathing as a result of living and studying so close to the polluted air. This situation now makes me think more about the quality of air where I live, and I know I will be taking it into account when deciding on where to live and where to work, after I graduate. I want to find out whether if people have also taken air quality into account when buying houses, hence this project idea came about.
## Plan
My plan is to compare the changes in housing prices and the changes in the Air Quality Index (also known as AQI, an indicator developed by agencies specializing in the environment to make the pollution in the air easily quantifiable and understandable, as there are many pollutants in the air at a given time) in a specific region over time.

### Data to be used
Currently, I intend to use the AQI and housing price data on a regular basis (such as per month) in California, United States. California is particularly populous, rich, and developed among the states of the U.S. Thanks to these attributes data is more easily available.
### Plans on collecting data
I plan to obtain this data through publicly-available online datasets and websites created by companies and organizations specializing in the relevant areas. Zillow, a real-estate marketplace company in the U.S. shares its date in a variety of forms including adjusted housing prices for research. Redfin, a real-estate broker firm also shares similar data. Either one of them or both can be used for housing data. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), shares its AQI recordings in an annual basis for every county (the administrative division one level below the state). IQAir, a private Swiss air quality technology company also records and shares AQI data globally. Again, either or both can be used for air quality data.
